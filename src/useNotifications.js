// 🔴 #341 KILL SWITCH — LEAVE THIS `false` UNTIL SQUARE PAYMENT CONFIRMATIONS
// ARE VERIFIED ARRIVING.
//
// Flip to `true` and the athlete-facing "you still owe us" nudges come back:
// the NotificationBell row and the StoreModal "My Purchases" pay link, both of
// which point at a LIVE Square checkout_url. Measured against the LIVE database
// on 2026-08-16: `store_webhook_events` holds ZERO rows — Square's payment
// webhook has never delivered a single event since the store went up in June
// 2026 — so `paid_at` and `square_payment_id` are NULL on ALL 130 lesson-pack
// purchases and every one of them sits at status='pending' with a live
// checkout_url still attached.
//
// status='pending' therefore means "Square never told us", NOT "the athlete
// owes money". Cordell has confirmed that several of these were in fact paid in
// Square. With this on, an athlete who already paid is shown a red badge
// telling them a payment is due and is handed a one-click link that charges
// their card a second time. That is real money out of a real customer, so this
// stays off — the nudge is worth less than one double charge.
//
// THE ONE CONDITION FOR FLIPPING IT ON: Square payment confirmations verified
// arriving end to end — `store_webhook_events` receiving rows for new payments
// AND `paid_at` populating on the matching store_purchases. Nothing else counts;
// a fixed webhook subscription that has not yet been observed writing those two
// things is not evidence. Until then pending is unfalsifiable and we must not
// bill on it. See also the #305 BOOKING_GATE_ENABLED switch in Schedule.js,
// which is off for the same root cause (the same 130 pending purchases).
//
// When it does go back on, the copy must NOT return to "Payment due" — see the
// wording in NotificationBell.js / StoreModal.js, which states only what we can
// evidence ("Payment not confirmed") and tells an athlete who already paid that
// no action is needed.

// #224 — Cordell asked for this in as many words: "Can you get a notification
// system to remind athletes who dont have their whoop connected to connect so
// we can start synching that data."
//
// It matters more than it looks. Measured against the live database on
// 2026-09-02: 20 of 976 athletes have a WHOOP linked. Most of that gap is not
// disinterest — WHOOP linking was silently broken from early June to 31 August
// (zero tokens created in that window; see the #394 investigation), so an
// athlete who tried over the summer clicked through, came back, and got
// nothing. They have no way of knowing it failed. This is what tells them.
//
// WHERE THE ANSWER COMES FROM. `users.whoop_connected` — the SAME column the
// whoop edge function itself treats as the source of truth (whoop/index.ts:479
// -483), and the same one it clears on disconnect (:324). A player can read
// their own row: the users SELECT policy is `id = auth.uid() OR
// get_user_is_staff()`.
//
// The first version of this asked the edge function instead, because
// `whoop_tokens` has RLS enabled with zero policies and the browser can never
// read it. That was true but beside the point — the flag we actually need is on
// the user's own row. Worse, that version depended on `getSession()` having a
// token at App mount and returned silently when it did not, with no retry and
// no log, so on a fresh sign-in it did nothing and said nothing. A plain
// PostgREST read is cheaper (one indexed row, not a function invocation on
// every player page load) and has no such ordering trap.
//
// IT FAILS CLOSED, AND THAT DIRECTION IS LOAD-BEARING. The nudge shows only
// when the read SUCCEEDS and the flag is not true. An error, a missing row, an
// unhydrated session — all leave it hidden, and all log. Getting this backwards
// would tell an athlete who IS connected to go and connect again, which is
// precisely the confusion #394 was about. A missed nudge costs nothing; a false

// #402 — tell a coach (and the admins) when a PT entry lands on one of their

// player has input anything into the physical therapy section."
//
// WHAT THIS ACTUALLY NOTIFIES ON, WHICH IS NOT QUITE WHAT THE ISSUE SAYS.
// Measured against the live database 2026-09-21: `pt_visits` INSERT/UPDATE/
// DELETE are staff-only ("staff insert pt visits" etc., all
// `get_user_role() = ANY ('admin','coach')`), and a player's only policy is
// `view own pt visits` (SELECT, `player_id = auth.uid()`). An athlete
// therefore CANNOT write a PT row today — every one of the 2 rows in the
// table was created by an admin. So this notifies on "a PT entry was logged
// for this athlete", by whoever logged it, which is the real event behind the
// request. If athlete-entered PT is ever added, this picks it up unchanged.
//
// SCOPE. PT visits only. The issue's second sentence ("any update on a
// players profile") would notify on every profile field in the app; that is a
// separate piece of work and is deliberately not built here.
//
// WHY THE READ MARKER IS IN localStorage AND NOT A TABLE. The count itself is
// derived — it is just `pt_visits` rows newer than a marker, the same shape as
// unread messages. The only thing that needs storing is the marker. There is
// no general-purpose per-user "last seen" table in this database (checked:
// the only *_reads tables are `message_reads`, `work_message_reads` and
// `facility_event_notice_reads`, all bound to their own feature's FK), so a
// server-side marker means new DDL — a table, three policies and a GRANT —
// that cannot be applied from here and would leave the feature dead on
// arrival until someone ran it. `nbp_book_welcome_seen` (PublicBookingPage)
// and the ExerciseVideoGaps exclusion list are the existing precedent for a
// per-browser "seen" marker in this app. The cost is real and is stated in the
// report: the marker is per browser, so a coach who uses a laptop and a phone
// dismisses the same notice twice.
//
// IT FAILS CLOSED IN EVERY DIRECTION THAT MATTERS. This table holds minors'
// health data. Every path that cannot positively establish both "this row is
// new to me" and "this athlete is mine" renders NOTHING: storage unreadable,
// roster lookup errored, visit query errored — all set an empty list and log.
// The first run on a browser records the marker and shows nothing at all,
// rather than dumping the backlog. And the query never asks for `pain_level`,
// `body_area`, `content` or `exercises` — the clinical columns are not
// fetched, so they cannot leak into the bell even by a later rendering
// mistake. Athlete name and date are the whole payload.
