                payment webhook never firing, that told athletes who HAD paid
                that they owed money and gave them one click to pay twice.
                useMainPortalCounts also returns an empty list while the flag is
                off, so this map has nothing to iterate either way — the guard
                stays so the two can't drift apart. While it's off, the admin
                delete path for an unconfirmed purchase is PackagesModal
                (Packages screen), which carries the same Square caution; who
                may delete is unchanged (RLS: store_purchases_delete_admin).
                The copy below is what shows when the flag goes back on: it
                states only what we can evidence — that no confirmation has
                reached us — and never asserts a debt. */}
